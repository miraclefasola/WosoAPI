## Performance Tips

1. **Use Specific Filters**: More specific queries return faster
2. **Limit Results**: Use `limit` parameter for better performance
3. **Index-Friendly Filters**: Use exact matches when possible
4. **Minimum Thresholds**: Use `minutes_played__gte` to filter out bench players
5. **Single Sort Field**: Use one `ordering` parameter for optimal performance
