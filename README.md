> **"Growing up watching women's football, I noticed something missing - the data wasn't there. While men's football analytics flourished with detailed stats and insights, women's football data remained scattered and incomplete. As someone passionate about both technology and women's sports, I built this API to bridge that gap. Every goal scored, every progressive pass made, every save - they all deserve to be measured, analyzed, and celebrated. This isn't just about numbers; it's about giving women's football the analytical foundation it deserves to grow, attract investment, and inspire the next generation of female athletes."**
