> **"With women's football, the data just isn't there. While men's football analytics flourished with detailed stats and insights, women's football data remained scattered and incomplete. As someone passionate about both technology and women's sports, I built this API to bridge that gap.This isn't just about numbers; it's about giving women's football the analytical foundation it deserves to grow, attract investment, and inspire the next generation of female athletes."**
